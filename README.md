# Assignment1-System-Development-and-Integration
note 1:The file System for question 2 is kinda wack so you may have to playaround with it but i tried to make it work as easy as possible
note2: Question3 was really rushed on my part and the code is really messy and the sliding the points isnt as smooth as i wanted it
to be but it still functions
note 4: you might have to change the path of the cards for Q1 as its customized for my system and i coulnt get the local directory
to work for finding the images.
